# Hidden Dimension VR experience/test project (UE5)

This project was initialized with Unreal Engine 5 on version 5.1.1 but has since been updated to 5.4.  It has been performance tested + optimized with Oculus Quest 2 connected with Link cable.

To open this project make sure you have the right version of Unreal Engine installed and a powerful enough PC.

If you do not have Unreal Engine you can download it here, providing your machine meets the system requirements: https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download
